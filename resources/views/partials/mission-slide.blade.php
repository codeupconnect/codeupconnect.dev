<h3 class="text-left">Welcome to CodeupConnect, the next step for Codeup graduates who are looking for extra projects to take on while looking for employment.</h3>
<h2 class="text-center font-semibold">What is <a href="http://www.codeup.com">Codeup</a>, you ask?</h2>
<h3 class="text-left">Codeup is an immersive Full-Stack program, providing a holistic understanding of the technologies powering today’s websites. From designing user interfaces on the front-end with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, to interacting with servers and crafting applications and databases on the back-end, grads leave the Full-Stack program with the skills to build a fully-functioning web app from the ground up.</h3>
<h2 class="text-center font-semibold">Sounds pretty cool, right?</h2>
<h3 class="text-left">After Codeup ends, graduates are eager to put their software development skills to work but the hiring process for companies is usually several weeks. In order to keep their skills sharp and marketable, they need to code daily but there’s only so much that can be reworked on their portfolios before they get bored of them. </h3>
<h2 class="text-center font-semibold">That’s where CodeupConnect comes into play.</h2>
<h3 class="text-left">We take project requests from you, organizations or non-profits helping any part of the San Antonio community, and pair them with our graduates who are looking for opportunities to gain experience and enhance their skills. The graduates provide a reworking or a website built from scratch for you and you get to continue doing amazing things for our community with upgraded exposure.</h3>
